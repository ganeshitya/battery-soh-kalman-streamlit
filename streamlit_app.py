st.write("""
This application simulates the degradation of a Lithium-Ion battery's State of Health (SOH)
and demonstrates how a Kalman Filter can estimate the true SOH from noisy measurements.

The 'True SOH' represents the actual, underlying battery degradation.
'Noisy Measurement' simulates what a sensor might observe, which is the True SOH plus random noise.
The 'Kalman Estimated SOH' is the filter's best guess of the True SOH,
combining its internal model of degradation with the noisy measurements.

    1.  **Simulated True SOH:** We define a ground truth for how the battery's SOH degrades over cycles.
    2.  **Simulated Noisy Measurements:** We generate sensor readings by adding random noise to the True SOH. These are the "observations" the Kalman Filter receives.
    3.  **Kalman Filter Prediction:** The filter predicts the next SOH based on its last estimate and an internal model of how SOH generally degrades (in this simple case, by subtracting `soh_degradation_per_cycle` from its current estimate). It also predicts its uncertainty.
    4.  **Kalman Filter Update:** When a new noisy measurement comes in, the filter compares it to its prediction. It then adjusts its SOH estimate, giving more weight to the prediction if the measurement is very noisy (high R) or more weight to the measurement if its prediction is very uncertain (high P or Q).
    5.  **Result:** The Kalman Estimated SOH is typically much smoother and closer to the True SOH than the raw, noisy measurements, demonstrating its ability to filter noise and provide an optimal estimate.

    * **High Measurement Noise (R):** The Kalman Filter will rely more on its prediction model, leading to a smoother but potentially slower-to-react estimate.
    * **High Process Noise (Q):** The filter will assume more uncertainty in its internal degradation model, making it more responsive to measurements but also more susceptible to measurement noise.
    * **Initial Estimate Uncertainty (P_0):** A high initial uncertainty tells the filter to trust the first few measurements more heavily. As it processes more data, this uncertainty reduces.
